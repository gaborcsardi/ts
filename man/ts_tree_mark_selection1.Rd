\title{Helper function to decide which AST nodes to highlight for a selection
(internal)}
\usage{
ts_tree_mark_selection1(tree, node)

\method{ts_tree_mark_selection1}{ts_tree}(tree, node)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{Tree-sitter tree.}

\item{node}{Node id, integer scalar.}
}
\value{
Integer vector of node ids to highlight.
}
\description{
This function are for packages implementing new parsers based on the ts
package. It is very unlikely that you will need to call this function
directly.
}
\details{
In parsers where AST nodes do not correspond one-to-one to DOM nodes
it is useful to highlight multiple AST nodes for a single selected
DOM node. This generic function can be overridden in such parsers to
return multiple AST node ids for a single selected (DOM) node id.

The default implementation simply returns the input node id.
